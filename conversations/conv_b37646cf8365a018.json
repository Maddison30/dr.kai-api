It is one of the body's ways to defend itself against these infections[<a href='https://www.1177.se/sjukdomar--besvar/infektioner/feber/feber/'>1</a>][<a href='https://www.1177.se/sjukdomar--besvar/infektioner/feber/feber-hos-barn/'>3</a>]. When an infection occurs, the body often reacts by raising its temperature to protect itself[<a href='https://www.1177.se/sjukdomar--besvar/infektioner/feber/'>2</a>]. \n\nIf you have a fever, it's important to monitor your symptoms. If your fever is high or persists for more than a few days, or if it's accompanied by other severe symptoms, you should seek medical attention. \n\nI am not a doctor. If symptoms worsen, contact a healthcare professional.",
